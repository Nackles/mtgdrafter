# Magic: The Gathering Chaos Draft Pack Randomizer

Website that takes Magic: The Gathering booster pack names and player count for random booster pack distribution during a Chaos Draft. Uses HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Javascript.

# Functionality
Currently, the barebones sites takes input and player count and will properly distribute boosters randomly and without duplication, but the booster array still contains hard-coded dummy names.

# How to Use
Directions are on the website - but you must open Google Dev Tools > Console in order to see the results (for now).
