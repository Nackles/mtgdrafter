# Magic: The Gathering Chaos Draft Pack Randomizer
Website that takes Magic: The Gathering booster pack names and player names for random booster pack distribution during a Chaos Draft. Uses HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Javascript. TODO: Use Mongo.

# The Site
https://nackles.github.io/mtgdrafter/

# Functionality
MTG drafter takes booster pack and player name input, counts the amount of each, and validates forms - denying empty input.

# TODO, in order:
TODO: Add validation to the ACTIVATE DRAFTER button to ensure the amount of packs is divisible by number of players without remainder. This is to ensure all/enough players and/or boosters were entered.
TODO: Add local storage and a reset button for persistence through sessions and accidental refresh.
TODO: Add Google Text Recognition API for booster pack scanning!
TODO: Add a round-robin tournament bracket system that will track wins/losses/colors.
TODO: Add Mongo support for all data storage.
TODO: MAKE IT PRETTY! ADD ANIMATION!

# How to Use
Directions are on the website - simply enter in the information and hit "ACTIVATE DRAFTER" for players to be assigned boosters!
